•Created interactive Tableau dashboards with filters, drill-down capabilities, and tooltips for dynamic exploration of cancer data trends and patterns.

•Developed a lung cancer detection project using a CNN algorithm with 81% accuracy.

•Enabled users to upload cancer reports for high-accuracy predictions by the CNN model.

•Enhanced model accuracy by 20% through extensive data preprocessing, including image normalization and augmentation.

•Integrated a Python Flask server for backend processing and communication with the CNN model, and created a front end for output display
